Created by Nuthouse01
Here's my package! I *think* if you just run the GUI it should run out-of-the-box with no extra configuration,
but to directly run any of the other files you need to execute "_RUN_THIS_TO_INSTALL.bat" and get this
directory properly registered as a "package" for your local Python.
Check out README.md for... well, everything I guess.
