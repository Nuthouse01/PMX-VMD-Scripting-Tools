"""
This folder contains a definition of the VMD format in Kaitai Struct syntax.
When I learned about Kaitai I thought it sounded really cool, and a good way to
document the VMD file structure that I had discovered. But Kaitai currently only
works for struct readers, not writers, so I this system is not a suitable
replacement for my VMD parser in core.
