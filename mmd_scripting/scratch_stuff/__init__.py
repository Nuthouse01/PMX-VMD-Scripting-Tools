"""
This is a bunch of partial scripts and stuff that might be useful if you know what you're doing,
but it's all kinda niche and/or wouldn't fit cleanly into the GUI package. I didn't fully document
or explain what all these things do. You're gonna need to open them with a text editor and look at
what they do and how they do it.

Many have options or parameters that are controlled with variables inside the file, instead of
prompting you for the values.

*DO NOT MOVE THE FILES* (unless you really know what you're doing)
Just double-click to execute them where they are.
