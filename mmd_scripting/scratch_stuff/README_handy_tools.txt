This is a bunch of partial scripts and stuff that might be useful if you know what you're doing,
but it's all kinda niche and/or wouldn't fit cleanly into the GUI package. I didn't fully document
or explain what all these things do. You're gonna need to open them with a text editor and look at
what they do and how they do it.

Many have options or parameters that are controlled with variables inside the file, instead of
prompting you for the values.


*DO NOT MOVE THE FILES*
I know the error says "all my stuff needs to be together in the same folder" its just because i'm too lazy to
change it. The handy_tools stuff is designed to be ran from right here. Double-click it or execute it on command line.
