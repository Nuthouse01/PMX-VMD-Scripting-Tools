prune_unused_bones:
This file identifies and deletes all bones in a PMX model that are NOT being used.
A bone is USED if any of the following are true:
    any vertex has nonzero weight with that bone
    rigid bodies use it as an anchor
    other used bones use it as parent, AKA it has children
    other used bones use it as a visual link point
    other used bones use it for 'append' (inherit movement and/or rotation)
    it is an IK bone or a link in the IK chain of an IK bone
A bone is UNUSED if none of these conditions are met.
All unused bones can be safely removed without affecting the current function of the model.
The common bones "dummy_L","dummy_R","glasses" are exceptions: they are semistandard accessory attachment points so they will not be removed even if they otherwise fit the definition of "unused" bones.
