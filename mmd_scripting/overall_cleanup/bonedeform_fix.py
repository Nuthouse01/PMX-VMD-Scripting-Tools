bonedeform_fix:
This function fixes bone deform order issues. This frequently occurs with "finger curl"-type bones.
Ensure that each bone will have its position/rotation calculated after all bones it inherits from.
This can usually be fixed by reordering bones but this script fixes it by modifying the bone deform layers instead.
Specifically this looks at parents, parial-inherit, and IK target/chains, and ensures that either the downstream bone is lower in the list or has a higher deform layer than its parents.
