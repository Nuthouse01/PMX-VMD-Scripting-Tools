# GOAL: sort vertices by UV coordinates
# PROBLEM: verts that have matching UV coords?
# SOLUTION: use xyz as tiebreaker... if uv exact match and xyz exact match, then order probably doesnt matter
# also need to update references to vertices
# vertices are referenced in faces, morphs (uv and vertex morphs), and soft bodies (should be handled just for completeness' sake)

# NOTES:
# this is used to guarantee matching vertex order for geometry that should be the "same" but comes from different sources
# this ordering is totally useless if the two versions have different numbers of vertices though!
# reduce the PMX to the smallest units possible & sort one by one
