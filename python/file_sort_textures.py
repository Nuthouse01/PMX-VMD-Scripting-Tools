file_sort_textures:
This tool will sort the tex/spheremap/toon files used by a model into folders for each category.
Unused image files can be moved into an "unused" folder, to declutter things.
Any files referenced by the PMX that do not exist on disk will be listed.
Before actually changing anything, it will list all proposed file renames and ask for final confirmation.
It also creates a zipfile backup of the entire folder, just in case.
Bonus: this can process all "neighbor" pmx files in addition to the target, this highly recommended because neighbors usually reference similar sets of files.

Note: *** means "all files within this folder"
Note: unfortunately, any "preview" images that exist cannot be distinguished from clutter, and will be moved into the "unused" folder. Remember to move them back!
Note: unlike my other scripts, this overwrites the original input PMX file(s) instead of creating a new file with a suffix. This is because I already create a zipfile that contains the original input PMX, so that serves as a good backup.
