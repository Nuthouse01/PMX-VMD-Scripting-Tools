vmd_animation_smoothing:
This script will modify a VMD and change the interpolation curve values to attempt to "smooth" all the motions.
This will work on both model motions and camera motions.
It does not change any of the actual keyframe poses.
It ignores any existing interpolation curves and creates new ones.
Results will not be perfect, but it should be a good starting point.
!!! THIS IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS !!!
There are many tuneable parameters near the top of the file, please experiment and find out what looks best to you.
