weight_cleanup:
This function will fix the vertex weights that are weighted twice to the same bone, a minor issue that sometimes happens when merging bones.
This also normalizes the weights of all vertices, and normalizes the normal vectors for all vertices.
Finally, it removes weight for any bones that have <0.001% weight, because it's imperceptible anyways.
