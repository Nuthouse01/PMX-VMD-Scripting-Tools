# this file simply contains commonly-used translation data
# most of these copied from PMXE's translation dict

# comments are what PMXE builtin translate actually translates them to, but i don't like those names

# NOTE: as of python 3.6, the order of dictionary items IS GUARANTEED. but before that it is not guaranteed.
# and it is very, very important to how the translator functions.
# NOTE: filtering stage means that all exact-match dicts should NOT contain fullwidth latin letters/numbers.
