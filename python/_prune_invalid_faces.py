This script will delete any invalid faces in the model, a simple operation.
An invalid face is any face whose 3 defining vertices are not unique with respect to eachother.
This also deletes any duplicate faces within material units (faces defined by the same 3 vertices) and warns about (but doesn not fix) duplicates spanning material units.
