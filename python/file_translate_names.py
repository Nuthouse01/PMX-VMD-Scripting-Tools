file_translate_names:
This tool will translate any JP components of file/folder names to EN names.
This requires a PMX file to use as a root so it knows where to start reading files from.
This DOES NOT translate the name of the folder that the target PMX is sitting inside.
Before actually changing anything, it will list all proposed file renames and ask for final confirmation.
It also creates a zipfile backup of the entire folder, just in case.
Bonus: this can process all "neighbor" pmx files in addition to the target, this highly recommended because neighbors usually reference similar sets of files.

Note: unlike my other scripts, this overwrites the original input PMX file(s) instead of creating a new file with a suffix. This is because I already create a zipfile that contains the original input PMX, so that serves as a good backup.
