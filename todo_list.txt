TODO: WIP-sdef-armtwist should invoke bone-sdeftwist-hand-adapter

TODO: examine professional SDEF armtwist examples (miku, bb, tamo) and create a graph that profiles the weight balance with respect to the length along the segment

TODO: create one function in 'core' that does all the bottom-of-the-script stuff...?
    also lets me add traceback module to everything

TODO: better incorporate traceback module with everything, remove the "debug" flag thing

TODO: add last-used-directory for each kind of file prompt, based on filtered extensions

TODO: simple flag in core that indicates 'running from gui' or not, wouldn't help with imports but might be useful
    in other contexts?

TODO: func 'normalize_texture_paths' in 'file_sort_textures' is pretty good, probably wanna add that to 'model_overall_cleanup'

TODO: overhaul the how VMD interpolation data is stored, restructure to a more sensible, intuitive arrangement

TODO: can i create one base class that is the parent of both VMD and PMX? they have almost identical features
    i'm worried that it would be confusing if i did that tho? hm...
