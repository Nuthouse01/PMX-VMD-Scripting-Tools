TODO: remove material morph items that point at -2 or invalid numbers? need to find a way to replicate this bug, see how it is saved so i know what to delete... also same in group morphs
TODO: split "core" files into multiple?

TODO: WIP-sdef-armtwist should invoke bone-sdeftwist-hand-adapter

TODO: examine professional SDEF armtwist examples (miku, bb, tamo, check SPS?, ab8/10, pojio, emu kawahara,) and create a graph that profiles the weight balance with respect to the length along the segment

TODO: simple flag in core that indicates 'running from gui' or not, wouldn't help with imports but might be useful
    in other contexts?

TODO: func 'normalize_texture_paths' in 'file_sort_textures' is pretty good, probably wanna add that to 'model_overall_cleanup'

TODO: can i create one base class that is the parent of both VMD and PMX? they have almost identical features
    i'm worried that it would be confusing if i did that tho? hm...

TODO: remove the pmx.faces member and instead break the faces into one sublist for each material object? is this easier
    or harder to understand? it lets me hide the "number of faces per material" field, which makes things simpler... and
    it makes it much easier to duplicate or delete materials... hm...

TODO: modify "create arm IK" script to use better structure/parameters


=======================================================================
IDEA: "motion de-interpolater" script
	i'm sick and tired of motions that are riddiculously "over-keyed"
	it makes the files way bigger than they need to be, and it makes them very difficult to adjust for other models
	assumption: all "mo-cap" dances truly are that complex, and probably cannot be reduced
	assumption: all "traced" dances have some reasonably simple underlying keyframe data, something that a person could make by hand, that has been deliberately over-keyed. if this assumption is true, then those over-key points should exactly fall along the interpolated line between some other two frames "nearby"
each bone/facial/camera should be analyzed independently, and use different logic for each category
facials are 1-dimensional, no interpolation curves, should be very easy
for bone/camera... 
	start/end pair is valid only if all channels of all intermediate frames can be mapped onto an interpolation curve between the startpoint/endpoint
	how can i reconstruct the bezier interpolation curve if given the points I want it to pass near or through? there must be math for this

	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6299019/how-can-i-fit-a-b%c3%a9zier-curve-to-a-set-of-data
	also, I want to check the exact amount of error in this curve-fit... some small degree of error is acceptable, i think. but the fundamental question is, "is there a constrained bezier curve that can run thru these points"?


IDEA: "pose deducer" script, if given a natural T/A-pose version of a model + that same model that has been baked into a different pose,
    i should be able to calculate exactly what pose was applied before it was baked! probably. it requires somehow being able to build
    correspondance between vertices across the two models... vertex order, face order, UV coordinates? probably no one-size-fits-all
    approach... i should also be able to do the same when all the bones have been deleted, yes? if I can build vertex correspondance
    then I can copy the weights over, and by deducing the rotate-around locations I can figure out the baked locations of the bones!
problems:
    no one-size-fits-all approach
    not always guaranteed to succeed
    requires learning the exact math behind BDEF1/2/4, SDEF weight schemes... BDEF seems standard but i can't find any references to SDEF on a quick google, might be a mmd-specific concept
    extremely difficult math to figure out, only 2 models I know of where this would be applicable, extracting the pose is a very small reward
conclusion: not worth it


IDEA2: "weight smoother" script, blend/blur the weights of a specified region!
    fully blend weights for all vertices that are exactly on the same point
    partially blend weights for each vertex with the weights of its neighbors (connected thru faces)
    I tried to do this once before... why did I give up? I think I didn't know how to deal with the "exactly colocating points"?
problem:
    how to let the user specify only one sub-region of a model? CSV mode is clunky but it works... how hard would it be to write my own plugin?

OTHER TOOLS

"VMD sizing tool"
has a bunch of features I don't understand
has github, I can steal ideas from him! :D
seems entirely JP tho, i bet the comments are JP as well :(


https://bowlroll.net/file/66955
"VMD twist-motion separator"
sounds exactly the same as my twist-decomposition script, right?
	but for some reason he says to use this to fix problems with the "shoulders"
	is that just a translation thing, or what?

"vmd animation smoothing tool"
tries to solve the same problem as my WIP vmd smoothing script, but uses a different approach
mine tries to leave keyframes where they are but build the bezier curves to be smooth
theirs uses massive overkeying and also changes the times/positions from the input
pros and cons
I wonder if i can find the source code anywhere?
