TODO: redo imports for all files
    figure out how to restructure into proper packages
    separate 'scripts' from 'functions'

TODO: establish template for 'scripts', i.e. contains main(), helptext... is that it?

TODO: make the GUI automatically find & import all 'scripts' in 'FOOBAR' folder, rather than manually listing them???
    can only be done after restructuring is complete

TODO BUG!!! deform order check incorrectly finds recursive relationship in Shimakaze... because of deform-after-phys
    not sure how i want to fix this

TODO: create one function in 'core' that does all the bottom-of-the-script stuff...?
    also lets me add traceback module to everything

TODO: overhaul 'create ik from vmd' script
    input 2 models & simulate on both

TODO: improve the 'file extension to filedialogue filter' thingy, surely i can do better
    add last-used-directory for each kind of file prompt, based on filtered extensions

TODO: simple flag in core that indicates 'running from gui' or not, wouldn't help with imports but might be useful
    in other contexts?

TODO: func 'normalize_texture_paths' in 'file_sort_textures' is pretty good, probably wanna add that to 'model_overall_cleanup'

TODO: overhaul the how VMD interpolation data is stored, restructure to a more sensible, intuitive arrangement

TODO: can i create one base class that is the parent of both VMD and PMX? they have almost identical features
    i'm worried that it would be confusing if i did that tho? hm...
