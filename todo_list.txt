TODO: redo imports for all files
    figure out how to restructure into proper packages
    separate 'scripts' from 'functions'

TODO: establish template for 'scripts', i.e. contains main(), helptext... is that it?

TODO: make the GUI automatically find & import all 'scripts' in 'FOOBAR' folder, rather than manually listing them???
    can only be done after restructuring is complete

#####

TODO: investigate improved autoarmtwist by Tamo, fix wrist crimping! the holy grail!

TODO: create one function in 'core' that does all the bottom-of-the-script stuff...?
    also lets me add traceback module to everything

TODO: overhaul 'create ik from vmd' script
    input 2 models & simulate on both

TODO: improve the 'file extension to filedialogue filter' thingy, surely i can do better

TODO: change the 'persistient storage' file to be dict-like so i can store more stuff more readably
    ex: last-used-directory for each kind of file prompt, based on filtered extensions
    ex: last-used-script
    maybe use json library? is there some clever way of rewriting just one line in a file if i change just one line,
    instead of rewriting the whole thing?

TODO: simple flag in core that indicates 'running from gui' or not, wouldn't help with imports but might be useful
    in other contexts?

TODO: func 'normalize_texture_paths' in 'file_sort_textures' is pretty good, probably wanna add that to 'model_overall_cleanup'

TODO: overhaul the how VMD interpolation data is stored, restructure to a more sensible, intuitive arrangement
