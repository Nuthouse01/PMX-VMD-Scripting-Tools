TODO: redo imports for all files
    figure out how to restructure into proper packages
    separate 'scripts' from 'functions'

TODO: establish template for 'scripts', i.e. contains main(), helptext... is that it?

TODO: make the GUI automatically find & import all 'scripts' in 'FOOBAR' folder, rather than manually listing them???
    can only be done after restructuring is complete

#####

TODO: "automatically set localaxis for certain bones"
TODO: auto armtwist stuff, force the armtwist bone to be colinear
TODO: WIP-sdef-armtwist should invoke bone-sdeftwist-hand-adapter
TODO: rename wip-sdef-armtwist to bone_make_sdef_auto_armtwist

TODO: create one function in 'core' that does all the bottom-of-the-script stuff...?
    also lets me add traceback module to everything

TODO: better incorporate traceback module with everything, remove the "debug" flag thing

TODO: overhaul 'create ik from vmd' script
    input 2 models & simulate on both

TODO: improve the 'file extension to filedialogue filter' thingy, surely i can do better
    add last-used-directory for each kind of file prompt, based on filtered extensions

TODO: simple flag in core that indicates 'running from gui' or not, wouldn't help with imports but might be useful
    in other contexts?

TODO: func 'normalize_texture_paths' in 'file_sort_textures' is pretty good, probably wanna add that to 'model_overall_cleanup'

TODO: overhaul the how VMD interpolation data is stored, restructure to a more sensible, intuitive arrangement

TODO: can i create one base class that is the parent of both VMD and PMX? they have almost identical features
    i'm worried that it would be confusing if i did that tho? hm...
