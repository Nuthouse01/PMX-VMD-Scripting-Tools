TODO: implement ability to invert/scale material morphs

TODO: WIP-sdef-armtwist should invoke bone-sdeftwist-hand-adapter

TODO: examine professional SDEF armtwist examples (miku, bb, tamo, check SPS?) and create a graph that profiles the weight balance with respect to the length along the segment

TODO: create one function in 'core' that does all the bottom-of-the-script stuff...?
    also lets me add traceback module to everything

TODO: better incorporate traceback module with everything, remove the "debug" flag thing

TODO: simple flag in core that indicates 'running from gui' or not, wouldn't help with imports but might be useful
    in other contexts?

TODO: func 'normalize_texture_paths' in 'file_sort_textures' is pretty good, probably wanna add that to 'model_overall_cleanup'

TODO: overhaul the how VMD interpolation data is stored, restructure to a more sensible, intuitive arrangement

TODO: can i create one base class that is the parent of both VMD and PMX? they have almost identical features
    i'm worried that it would be confusing if i did that tho? hm...

OTHER TOOLS

https://bowlroll.net/file/197410
"VMD sizing tool"
has a bunch of features I don't understand
has github, I can steal ideas from him! :D
seems entirely JP tho, i bet the comments are JP as well :(


https://bowlroll.net/file/66955
"VMD twist-motion separator"
sounds exactly the same as my twist-decomposition script, right?
	but for some reason he says to use this to fix problems with the "shoulders"
	is that just a translation thing, or what?

"vmd animation smoothing tool"
tries to solve the same problem as my WIP vmd smoothing script, but uses a different approach
mine tries to leave keyframes where they are but build the bezier curves to be smooth
theirs uses massive overkeying and also changes the times/positions from the input
pros and cons
I wonder if i can find the source code anywhere?
