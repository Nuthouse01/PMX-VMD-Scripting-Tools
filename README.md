I take no responsibility for how you use this code: any damages, or copyright violations or other illegal activity are completely the fault of the user. These tools only gives you "the ability to read/edit", what you do with that ability is not my business and not my fault.  
You are free to use this for any commercial or non-commercial applications.  
Don't try to claim this work as yours. That would be a profoundly dick move.

###### Usage:
1. Click the green button above, select "Download ZIP", save it, and unzip it somewhere.
2. Just double-click "graphic_user_interface.exe" to open the user interface window. (For simplicity I recommend you use the EXE version. No installation is required. But if you want to run the PY versions or modify the code, you will need to [Install Python3](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+install+python) and the "googletrans" library ("pip install googletrans==4.0.0-rc1").)
    1. If you get a popup saying "Windows protected your PC", you can click "More Info" and then "Run Anyway". This does not mean that it detected a virus (that is a different popup), this happens whenever you run an EXE from an unknown publisher, like me.
3. Use the dropdown menu at the top to select which script you want to run. You can press the "Help" button to print out a detailed explanation of what the currently selected script does, how it does it, and what output files it creates.
4. Click the large "RUN" button to the left to execute the selected script. This will begin by prompting you for input file(s), and will then run to completion. Outputs and info will be printed in the large space at the bottom of the window.
    1. If the "print extra info" checkbox is checked when the "RUN" button is clicked, more detailed info will be printed as the script runs.
5. Read all information that is printed to the screen (such as whether it succeeded or failed), then leave the window open. You can click "RUN" again to run the same script (it will prompt you again for input file(s)) or you can switch to a different script with the dropdown menu and run something else instead. You can click "Clear" to clear the printout space if it gets too messy.
6. Enjoy!

### Purpose:
##### model_overall_cleanup.py
This will perform a series of first-pass cleanup operations to generally improve any PMX model. This includes: translating missing english names (via Google Translate!), correcting alphamorphs, normalizing vertex weights, pruning invalid faces & orphan vertices, removing bones that serve no purpose, pruning imperceptible vertex morphs, cleaning up display frames, and detecting issues that might cause MMD to crash. These operations will reduce file size (sometimes massively!) and improve overall model health & usability.

##### file_sort_textures.py
This script is for organizing the texture imports used in a PMX model, to eliminate "top-level" clutter and sort Tex/Toon/SPH files into folders based on how they are used. This script will also report any files it finds that are not used by the PMX, and it will also report any files the PMX tries to reference which do not exist in the file system.

##### file_translate_names.py
This is for translating JP names of files to English. Unlike the "file_sort_textures" script, this will attempt to rename ALL files within the tree, it will not restrict itself to only certain filetypes.

##### check_model_compatability.py
This script is to check if the model you are using is compatible with the VMD/VPD you wish to use. This will display a summary that lists all the bones/morphs in the VMD/VPD file that are not supported by the model. If you are loading a motion designed for some different model (usually the case), and it seems to be playing wrong, it is very likely that there is a name mismatch.

(For example, if a model's eye-smile morph is named "笑い" and the motion uses "笑顔" for eye-smile, that morph will not be applied to the model and it will look wrong when played.)

This script will reveal what exactly is mismatched; but to fix the issue, you must either change the PMX to match the VMD/VPD (using PMXEditor or a similar tool) or you must change the VMD/VPD to match the PMX (use script "vmd_rename_bones_morphs" to do find-and-replace within the VMD!).

##### bone_auto_armtwist.py
This will generate "automatic armtwist rigging" that will fix pinching at shoulders/elbows.  
**This only works on models that already have semistandard armtwist/腕捩 and wristtwist/手捩 bone rigs.** Install the "Semi-Standard Bone Plugin" in PMXE to create these bones if they do not exist.  
It creates a clever IK bone setup that hijacks the semistandard bones and moves them as needed to reach whatever pose you make with the arm/腕 or elbow/ひじ bones. You do not need to manually move the armtwist bones at all, you can animate all 3 axes of rotation on the arm bone and the twisting axis will be automatically extracted and transferred to the armtwist bone as needed!

##### morph_hide.py
This script simply sets the specified morphs within a model to group "0" so they do not show up in the eye/lip/brow/other menus. This is handy for components of group morphs that you don't want to be used independently.

##### morph_invert.py
This will "invert" a vertex or UV morph by permanently applying it to the model's mesh, then reversing the values inside that morph.

##### morph_scale.py
This will scale the strength/magnitude of a vertex, UV, or bone morph by a specified factor such as 2.9 or 0.75.

##### convert_vmd_to_txt.py
This tool is for converting VMD (Vocaloid Motion Data) files from their packed binary form to a human-readable and human-editable text form, and vice versa. This can allow 3rd-party scripts to perform procedural edits on the VMD data while it is in text format, such as (for example) constraining certain bones to a desired max range of motion, and then converting it back to VMD form for use in MikuMikuDance. Or it can be used to modify the names of the bones/morphs that the VMD is trying to control, to customize it to work better with a specific model.

##### convert_vpd_to_vmd.py
This script will convert VPD (Vocaloid Pose Data) files to or from VMD (Vocaloid Motion Data) files. The motion files will be only a single frame long, with all bones/morphs framed at time=0.

### Notes:
Note: if you want to run the Python version rather than the EXE version, you will need have Python 3.6 or higher and need to install the "googletrans" library (pip install googletrans). This is the only non-standard library used in my codebase.

Note: the EXE file is so much larger than all the Python scripts because it was bundled with PyInstaller, and contains an entire portable Python installation. Technically, when it runs it unpacks & installs Python to a temporary location, executes all of my Python scripts, and when the window is closed it deletes that temporary location.

Note: Bones and morphs are stored in the VMD format by their JAPANESE NAME. It is not possible to get any english name info from the VMD.

Note: The following data can be controlled by keyframes and stored within an MMD project, but cannot be stored in or restored by a VMD file:
* gravity data
* outside parent settings
* accessory data

Note: "morph" is a synonym for "facial"

Note: If using an English-translated version of MikuMikuDance, you will not be able to directly see the Japanese names of bones/morphs in your model. To see the Japanese names, either use PMXEditor or use the script "pmx_list_bone_morph_names.py" to create files that link each JP name with its corresponding EN name.

Note: if you want to examine/modify VPD (Vocaloid Pose Data) files, they are already stored as plain-text. Right-click the file and attempt to open it with whatever text editor you prefer.

Note: the VMD structure allocates a specific number of bytes to hold the name of each bone/morph, but sometimes these names are too long to be stored and get truncated down to that maximum size. Also, sometimes it takes 2 bytes to represent a single kanji: if the truncate point is in the middle of a kanji, it loses the 2nd byte and I cannot decode that kanji for printing or displaying. To prevent data loss, I use an escape character "‡" with two hex digits to represent the final dangling byte while it is in string form. (If you don't understand anything I just said then don't worry about it.)

### VMD text-file structure:

This is formatted in CSV (comma-separated value) format. You can theoretically change the file extension from .txt to .csv and open it with Microsoft Excel or whatever, but Excel isn't capable of properly displaying the Japanese characters so that isn't recommended.

The text file is encoded with "utf-8" scheme, and should be displayable by any text editor.

Bone-rotation angles are converted from quaternion format and outputted as euler or "real" angles in degrees, the same values that are displayed in MMD. Camera-rotation angles have no limits and are shown in degrees.

### VMD binary structure:

This is only included because I don't have permissions to update the MikuMikuDance Fandom page with all the info I discovered. It would be a shame if it just vanished forever, so I'll post it here.

The binary file is encoded with "shift_jis" scheme.

Some really old motions that don't contain camframe/lightframe/shadowframe/ikdispframe may just end the bitstream early rather than specifying that there are 0 of each of these frame types. This early-end is supported but will cause warnings to be printed.

Note: When doing conversion from txt->VMD, I append a signature string "Nuthouse01" to prove that this file was created by my conversion tool.
This does not affect MikuMikuDance, MikuMikuMoving, PMXE, or MMDTools (Blender plugin) from successfully reading the motion.

Technically, the VMD binary file structure allows having both model data (bones, morphs, ikdisp) and cam data (cam, light, shadow) in the same file at the same time. However, MikuMikuDance will ignore model data and read only the cam data if the modelname is exactly "カメラ・照明" (TL: Camera / Lighting), and will ignore cam data and read only the model data if the modelname is anything else.

###### Thanks:
Massive thanks and credit to "Isometric" for helping me discover the quaternion transformation method used by MMD!!!! The script wouldn't be completable without him :)

Thank you to whoever made [this VMD documentation page](https://mikumikudance.fandom.com/wiki/VMD_file_format), their documentation is incomplete but their work is the only reason I was able to even begin this project!

Also thanks to [FelixJones on Github](https://gist.github.com/felixjones/f8a06bd48f9da9a4539f) for already exploring & documenting the PMX file structure!

Big thanks to "Quappa-El" for inventing the automatic armtwist bone structure that my "bone_auto_armtwist" script copies. Once I had a working example in front of me, it took only 2 days to put together the script that lets me apply it onto any model.

Thanks to the people who made PyInstaller for making a super easy way to build an .exe from a bunch of Python scripts, its a really neat tool you should check it out. The EXE files are so large because it contains the entire Python kernel + all needed libraries for that script. "pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole whatever.py"

v4.63:
tweak printouts in a couple places
more commenting & typechecking stuff
translation: force translation when english names are just "en" or "D"
translation: tighten criteria for "good" english names to highlight any funny unicode symbols and junk

    new stage to look for exact matches in special dicts before trying to do piecewise local translation with general dict
    new approach to google translation: identify translateable islands/chunks and only translate those, assuming they will be used many times
        this should reduce google traffic in extreme cases and guarantee consistient translations
    force "words dict" to be sorted by size to prevent future "undershadowing" problems
    add new struct for holding the translation data as I am running, for better organization than just a list-of-lists
    fewer printouts when using "moreinfo": skip the exact-match and copy-JP entries cuz they're uninteresting
restructure "weight_cleanup" slightly, now compresses weight vect to lowest possible version
added WIP scripts "pmx_magic_armtwist" and "bone_merge_helpers", they're not ready yet please don't use them :) i just needed them out of the way
added smart gui-wise justifying to make things line up more nicely

more translation words
warn about bone/morph names that can't be stored in SHIFT-JIS
prune unused bones: actually check that IK bones are used instead of just assuming
refine boneless rigidbody checks & warnings
automatically fix edging on default hidden materials with "show" morphs

added PMX WRITE ability
    various restructuring and improvment of my custom pack/unpack functions, now both use the same recursive approach
print statement changes: binary/text file read/write print full absolute file path, read/write pmx/vmd print only basename

v3.01:
"prompt_user_filename" now prints the full file path when given a non-existant file
added .exe versions of all 5 scripts, generated with PyInstaller

v3.00:
removed scripts for PMX editing, left only scripts for VMD manipulation and tools to help with that
massive refactoring of "vmd_convert_tool":
    move funcs for reading/writing binary files into core
    move funcs for unpacking structs into core
    move funcs for parsing/writing VMDs into new file "vmd_parser"
        further refactored these funcs for stronger encapsulation & readability
    massive refactoring of funcs for parsing/writing VMD-as-text for stronger encapsulation & readability
    end-user experience is unchanged except for print statement differences
slightly changed the "nicelist" format for internally representing a VMD
completely redid my binary unpacker function, changed to a recursive approach
    now supports symbol "t" to indicate actual strings (packer also changed to support this)
    now creates escape character(‡) & writes the actual byte when unable to translate the final byte of a string (packer also changed to support this)
    discovered some more quirks of encoding/decoding shift_jis, listed in core file
added new file "pmx_parser", thanks to FelixJones on Github for already exporing & documenting the PMX file structure!!!
    only for reading PMX files, no plans to make a writer. If you wanna modify a PMX use PMXE, not my scripts!
    uses core funcs for reading binary files
    uses core funcs for unpacking binary structs (same function as VMD parser)
updated "vmd_armtwist_convert" to use this new PMX parser, and to work with VMD parsing changes
    now able to infer axis of rotation on armtwist bones even if it doesn't have its axis locked
updated "vmd_compatability_check" to use this new PMX parser, and to work with VMD parsing changes
    also changed comparison method to handle new escape char strategy and bones/morphs >= 15 bytes
updated "make_ik_from_vmd" to use this new PMX parser, and to work with VMD parsing changes
improved handling of user input file names to account for odd corner cases
improved error handling when reading vmd-as-text files
change how "read_txt_to_rawlist" detects if a thing is an int, so it can support negative ints
add ability for "read_txt_to_rawlist" to parse None objects (but there shouldn't ever be any None objects in the file so w/e)
add new script "pmx_list_bone_morph_names.py" so EN users can discover the JP names of a model without using PMXE
decided to release this script under the name Nuthouse01, changed all uses accordingly

v2.09:
fixed a logical bug in "bone_endpoint_create_remove"
stopped using default, built custom csv writer to preserve leading spaces of things
bugfix in "vmd_convert_tool" to handle strings exactly 15 bytes long that end with a multibyte char
speculative bugfix to handle multibyte chars that get cut off by 15-byte limit (is that even possible?)

2.08:
fixed a bug in "identify_unused_bones" due to not actually testing my code
changed encoding from "shift_jisx0213" to "shift_jis" to properly handle backslashes, in core and in VMD
New scripts:
+bone_geometry_isolate
+vmd_armtwist_convert
+bone_endpoint_create_remove
+texture_file_sort
moved more functions into the 'core' file

2.07:
fixed a bug in "weight_cleanup" due to not actually testing my code

2.06:
created new script "vmd_model_compatability_check"
in "vmd_convert_tool", disabled the writing of bonedict/morphdict because vmd_model_compatability_check overshadows that feature

2.05:
moved some code to "nuthouse01_core"
decided to distribute all scripts as a bundle
added several simple scripts
enforced standard templating for all scripts

2.04:
vmd_convert_tool:
    quaternion transform fix
    bonedict/morphdict sorting
    added "choose from options" function
    added selftest

2.03:
vmd_convert_tool:
    better functionalization
    better support for old motions (early end)
    moved when the sorting happens
```
